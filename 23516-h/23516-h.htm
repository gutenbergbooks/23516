    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the afternoon before the closing day of the spring meeting of the
      old Jockey Club that so many people know. The next day was to be the
      greatest ever known on that course; the Spring Meeting was to go out in a
      blaze of glory. As to this everybody in sight this spring afternoon was
      agreed; and the motley crowd that a little before sunset stood clustered
      within the big white-painted gate of the grounds about the Jockey Club
      race-stables rarely agreed as to anything. From the existence of the Deity
      to the effect of a blister on a windgall, through the whole range of
      stable-thought and horse-talk, there was no subject, speaking generally,
      on which that mongrel population agreed, except, of course, on one thing&mdash;the
      universal desirability of whiskey. On this one subject they all agreed,
      always.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet they were now all of one mind on the fact that the next day was to be
      the record on that course. In the first place, the prize in the great
      over-night event, the steeplechase set for the morrow, was the biggest
      ever offered by the club, and the &ldquo;cracks&rdquo; drawn together for the occasion
      were the best ever collected at a meeting on that course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even such noted steeplechasers as Mr. Galloper's Swallow, Colonel
      Snowden's Hurricane, and Tim Rickett's Carrier Pigeon, which had
      international reputations, were on hand for it, and had been sent &ldquo;over
      the sticks&rdquo; every morning for a week in hopes of carrying off such a
      prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, however, one other reason for the unwonted unanimity. Old Man
      Robin&mdash;&ldquo;Col-onel-Theodoric-Johnston's-Robin-suh&rdquo;&mdash;said it was to
      be the biggest day that was ever seen on that track, and in the memory of
      the oldest stable-boss old Robin had never admitted that any race of the
      present could be as great, &ldquo;within a thousand miles,&rdquo; as the races he used
      to attend &ldquo;befo' de wah, when hosses ran all de way from Philidelphy to
      New Orleans.&rdquo; Evil-minded stable-men and boys who had no minds&mdash;only
      evil&mdash;laid snares and trapfalls for &ldquo;Colonel Theodoric Johnston's
      Robin, of Bull-field, suh,&rdquo; as he loved to style himself, to trip him and
      inveigle him into admissions that something was as good now as before the
      war; but they had never succeeded. The gang had followed him to the gate,
      where he had been going off and on all the afternoon, and were at their
      mischief now while he was looking somewhat anxiously out up the parched
      and yellow dusty road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess freedom 's better 'n befo' d' wah?&rdquo; hazarded one of his
      tormentors, a hatchet-faced, yellow stable-boy with a loud, sharp voice.
      He burst into a strident guffaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe, you does,&rdquo; growled Robin. He edged off, rubbing his ear. &ldquo;Befo' de
      wah you 'd be mindin' hawgs&mdash;what you ought to be doin' now, stidder
      losin' races an' spilin' somebody's hosses, mekin' out you kin ride.&rdquo; A
      shout of approving derision greeted this retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Robin was a man of note on that circuit. It was the canon of that
      crowd to boast one's self better than everyone else in everything, but
      Robin was allowed to be second only to the speaker and the superior of
      everyone else with a unanimity which had its precedent only after Salamis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robin had been head of Colonel Theodoric Johnston's stable before the war,
      the time on which his mind dwelt with tender memory; and this, with the
      consideration with which he was treated by stable-owners and
      racing-gentlemen who shone like luminaries on the far edge of the
      stable-boys' horizon, and the old man's undoubted knowledge of a horse,
      made him an authority in that world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bullfield stable had produced some of the greatest horses of the
      country&mdash;horses to which the most ignorant stable-biped knew the
      great winners of the present traced back their descent or were close akin&mdash;and
      if Colonel Johnston's stable lost anything of prestige, it was not in
      Robin's telling of it. He was at it now as he stood at the big white gate,
      gazing up the road, over which hung a haze of dust. Deucalion, Old Nina,
      Planet, Fanny Washington, and the whole gleaming array of fliers went by
      in Robin's illumined speech, mixed up with Revenue, Boston, Timoleon, Sir
      Archy and a dozen others in a blaze of equine splendor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, what 're you giffin us!&rdquo; jeered a dusky young mulatto, clad in a
      ragged striped sweater, recently discharged as a stable-boy. &ldquo;What wus the
      time then? Why 'n't you read the book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a dig at Robin, for he was &ldquo;no great hand at reading,&rdquo; and the
      crowd knew it and laughed. The old man turned on the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Races now ain't no mo' than quarter-dashes. Let 'em try 'em in fo'-mile
      heats if they want to see what 's in a hoss. Dat 's the test o' wind an'
      bottom. <i>Our</i> hosses used to run fo'-mile heats from New York to New
      Orleans, an' come in with their heads up high enough to look over dis
      gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why 'n't you read the books?&rdquo; persisted the other, facing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't read not much better than you ken <i>ride</i>,&rdquo; retorted Robin.
      This was a crusher in that company, where riding stood high above any
      literary attainment; for the other had been a failure as a jockey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to rally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'll bet you a hundred dollars I can&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robin gazed at him witheringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain' got a hunderd dollars; you ain't got a hunderd cents! You would
      n't 'a' been wuth a hunderd dollars in slave-times, an' I know you ain'
      wuth it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man, with a final observation that he did n't want to have to go
      to court as a witness when folks were taken up for stealing their master's
      money, took out and consulted his big gold stop-watch. That was his
      conclusive and clinching argument. It was surprising what an influence
      that watch exercised. Everyone who knew Robin knew that watch had been
      given him before the war as a testimonial by the stewards of the Jockey
      Club. It had the indisputable record engraved on the case, and had been
      held over the greatest race-horses of the country. Robin could go up to
      the front door of the club and ask for the president&mdash;he possessed
      this exclusive privilege&mdash;and be received with an open hand and a
      smile, and dismissed with a jest. Had not Major McDowell met him, and
      introduced him to a duke as one of his oldest friends on the turf, and one
      who could give the duke more interesting information about the horses of
      the past than any other man he knew? Did not Colonel Clark always shake
      hands with him when they met, and compare watches? So now, when, as the
      throng of horse-boys and stable-attendants stood about him, Robin drew his
      watch and consulted it, it concluded his argument and left him the victor.
      The old trainer himself, however, was somewhat disturbed, and once more he
      gazed up the road anxiously. The ground on which he had predicted the
      greatness of the next day was not that the noted horses already present
      were entered for the race, but much more because he had received a letter
      from one whom he sometimes spoke of as &ldquo;one of his childern,&rdquo; and
      sometimes as &ldquo;one of his young masters&rdquo;&mdash;a grandson of his old
      master, Colonel Theodoric Johnston of Bullfield&mdash;telling him that he
      was going to bring one of his horses, a colt his grandfather had given
      him, and try for the big steeplechase stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Robin had arranged the whole matter for him, and was now awaiting him,
      for he had written that he could not get there until late in the day
      before the race, as he had to travel by road from the old place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though old Robin let no one know of his uneasiness, he was watching now
      with great anxiety, for the sun was sinking down the western sky toward
      the green bank of trees beyond the turn into the home stretch, and in an
      hour more the entries would be closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he waited he beguiled the time with stories about his old master's
      stable, and about the equine &ldquo;stars&rdquo; that shone in the pedigree of this
      horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Johnston's fortune had gone down with the close of the war, and
      when his stable was broken up he had recommended his old trainer to one of
      his friends and had placed him with a more fortunate employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robin had not seen his old master's grandson for years&mdash;not since he
      was a little boy, when Robin had left home&mdash;and he pictured him as a
      dashing and handsome young gentleman, such as he remembered his father
      before him. As to the horse, not Sir Archy himself had been greater. Robin
      talked as though he had had the handling of him ever since he was dropped;
      and he ran over a pedigree that made the boys about him open their wicked
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then a stable-boy discerned out on the highway across the field a
      rider, coming along at a swinging trot that raised the dust and shot it in
      spurts before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yonder he come now!&rdquo; cried the urchin, with a grimace to attract the
      attention of the crowd. They looked in the direction indicated, and then
      in' chorus began to shout. Old Robin turned and glanced indifferently down
      the road. The next instant he wheeled and his black hand made a clutch at
      the boy, who dodged behind half a dozen others as a shout of derisive
      laughter went up from the throng. What Robin saw was only a country lad
      jogging along on a big raw-boned, blazed-faced horse, whose hipbones could
      be seen even at that distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know dat ain't my horse!&rdquo; said the old man, sharply. &ldquo;You young boys
      is gittin' too free with you' moufs! Dat horse&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest of his speech, however, was lost; for at that moment the horseman
      turned from the highway into the road to the race-course and came swinging
      on toward the gate. The gang behind old Robin broke into renewed jeers,
      but at the same time kept well out of his reach; for the old man's face
      bore a look that no one dared trifle with, and he had a heavy hand on
      occasion, as many of them had come to know. His eyes now were fastened on
      the horse that was rapidly approaching through a cloud of dust on the
      yellow road, and a look of wonder was growing on his brown face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rider pulled rein and drew up just outside the open gate, looking down
      on the group there in some bewilderment Then his eyes lighted up, as the
      old trainer stepped out and, taking off his hat, put forth his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Robin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My young master.&rdquo; He took the bridle just as he might have done years
      before had his old master ridden up to the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The act impressed the gang behind him as few things could have done, and
      though they nudged one another, they fell back and huddled together rather
      farther away, and only whispered their ridicule among themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy sprang from the saddle, and the old man took possession of the
      horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were a strange-looking pair, horse and rider, fresh from the country,
      both of them dusty and travel-stained, and, as the stable-boys whispered
      among themselves, both &ldquo;starving for the curry-comb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lad passed in at the gate, whipping the dust from his clothes with the
      switch he carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robin glared back fiercely to see that no insolent response was made, but
      there was no danger. The voice and manner were such that many a hand
      jerked up to a cap. Besides, the young lad, though his clothes were old
      and travel-stained, and his hair was long and was powdered with dust,
      showed a clean-cut face, a straight back, broad shoulders, and muscular
      legs, as he strode by with a swing which many a stable-boy remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robin led the horse away around the end of the nearest stable. No one
      would have known his feelings, for he kept a severe countenance, and broke
      out on the nearest stable-boy with fierce invective for not getting out of
      his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse carried his head high, and, with pointed ears, wide eyes, and
      dilated nostrils, inspected everything on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only when the new-comer and Robin were out of hearing that the
      jeers broke out aloud, and even then several of the on-lookers, noting the
      breeding along with the powerful muscles and flat bone, asserted that it
      was &ldquo;a good horse, all the same.&rdquo; They had eyes for a good horse.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      As the old trainer led the horse away around the long stables, the low
      rumble of far-off thunder grumbled along the western horizon&mdash;Robin
      glanced in that direction. It might mean a change in the chances of every
      horse that was to run next day. The old man looked downcast; the boy's
      countenance cleared up. He scanned the sky long and earnestly where a dull
      cloud was stretching across the west; then he followed the horse among the
      long lines of low buildings with a quickened step.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till they had reached a box-stall in an old building far off in
      one corner of the grounds that the old negro stopped. When he had been
      expecting another horse&mdash;the horse of which he had boasted to his
      entire acquaintance&mdash;he had engaged in advance a box in one of the
      big, new stables, where the descendant of the kings would be in royal and
      fitting company. He could not bring himself now to face, with this
      raw-boned, sunburnt colt, the derisive scrutiny of the men who had heard
      him bragging for a week of what his young master would show them when he
      came. Yet it was more on his young master's account than on his own that
      he now slunk away to this far-off corner. He remembered his old master,
      the king of the turf, the model of a fine gentleman, the leader of men;
      whose graciousness and princely hospitality were in all mouths; whose word
      was law; whose name no one mentioned but with respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered his young master as he rode away to the war on one of the
      thoroughbreds, a matchless rider on a matchless horse. How could he now
      allow their grandson and son, in this rusty suit, with this rusty colt at
      which the stable-boys jeered, to match himself against the finest men and
      horses in the country? He must keep him from entering the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the old fellow stopped before the stall and glanced at the horse he
      had been leading, his face changed. It took on the first look of interest
      it had worn since the horse had appeared on the road in a cloud of dust.
      He was standing now directly in front of him. His eyes opened. The deep
      chest, the straight, clean legs with muscles standing out on the forearms
      in big knots, the fine head with its broad, full brow, its wide eyes full
      of life and intelligence, the delicate muzzle, suddenly caught his eye. He
      took a step to one side, and scanned the horse from top to hoof, and his
      face lighted up. Another step, and he ran his hand over him, up and down,
      from topknot to fetlock, from crest to croup. At every touch his eyes
      opened wider.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umhm! He hard as a rock!&rdquo; He was talking aloud, but to himself. &ldquo;He 's
      got de barrel to stay, an' he leg jes as clean as a pin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first word of praise he had vouchsafed. The young owner's face
      lighted up. He had felt the old man's disappointment, and his heart had
      been sinking. It was lifted now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say he pedigree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imported Learn&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. Dat 's de blood! Imported Leamington&mdash;Fanny Wash'n' by
      Revenue! He 'll do. Hit 's bred in de bone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see such bone?&rdquo; the boy asked, running his hand over the big
      knee-joint.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old trainer made no answer. He glanced furtively around to see that no
      one heard the question. Then he went on feeling the horse, inch by inch.
      Every muscle and sinew he ran his hand over, and each moment his face
      cleared up more and more. &ldquo;He ain' nothin' but rock!&rdquo; he said,
      straightening up. &ldquo;Walk him off dyah, son&rdquo;&mdash;with a wave of his hand&mdash;&ldquo;<i>walk</i>
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was as if he were speaking to a stable-boy. He had now forgotten all
      but the horse, but the young man understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the bridle, but the horse did not wait. At the first step he was
      up with him, with a long, swinging stride as springy as if he were made of
      rubber, keeping his muzzle close to his master's shoulder, and never
      tightening his rein. Now and then he threw up his head and gazed far over
      beyond the whitewashed fence toward a horse galloping away off on the
      curving track, as if there were where his interest lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Straight as a plank,&rdquo; muttered the old trainer, with a toss of his head.
      &ldquo;'Minds me o' Planet. Got de quarters on him.&mdash;Bring him back!&rdquo; he
      called.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the young man returned, the older one asked, &ldquo;Can he run?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run! Want to see him move!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for an answer, he vaulted into the saddle and began to
      gather up the reins. The horse lifted his head and gathered himself
      together, but he did not move from his tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait. How far is you come to-day?&rdquo; demanded Robin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About forty miles. I took it easy.&rdquo; He turned the horse's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man gave an exclamation, part oath, part entreaty, and grabbed for
      the reins just as the boy was turning toward the track, where a
      whitewashed board fence stood over four feet high.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait&mdash;whar you gwine! Forty mile! Whar you gwine? Wait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over into the track. That fence is nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He settled himself in the saddle, and the horse threw up his head and drew
      himself together. But old Robin was too quick for him. He clutched the
      rider by the leg with one hand at the same time that he seized the bridle
      with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git off him; git off him!&rdquo; Without letting go the bridle, he half lifted
      the boy from the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won't hurt him, Uncle Robin. He 's used to it. That fence is
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gi' me dis hoss dis minute. Forty mile, an' 'spec' to run to-morrow! Gi'
      me dis hoss dis minute, boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young owner yielded with a laugh, and the old trainer took possession
      of the horse, and led him on, stopping every now and then to run his hand
      over his sinewy neck and forelegs, and grumbling to himself over the
      rashness of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jes like he pa,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Never could teach him to tek keer o' a
      hoss. Think all a hoss got to do is to run! Forty mile, an' want to put
      him at a five-foot fence when he cold as a wedge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he was inside the stable his manner changed. His coat was off in an
      instant, and no stable-boy could have been more active. He set about
      grooming the horse with the enthusiasm of a boy, and the horse after the
      first inquisitive investigation of his new attendant, made with eye and
      nose, gave himself up to his care. The young owner did the same, only
      watching him closely to learn the art of grooming from a past-master of
      the craft.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time in years that Robin had played hostler; and it was
      the first time in his life that that horse had ever had such a grooming.
      Every art known to the professor of the science was applied. Every muscle
      was rubbed, every sinew was soothed. And from time to time, as at touch of
      the iron muscles and steel sinews the old fellow's ardor increased, he
      would straighten up and give a loud puff of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph! Ef I jist had about a week wid him, I 'd show 'em som'n'!&rdquo; he
      declared. &ldquo;Imported Learn&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He don't need any time. He can beat anything in this country,&rdquo; asserted
      the owner from his perch on a horse-bucket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain' see 'em all,&rdquo; said Robin, dryly, as he bent once more to his
      work. &ldquo;An' it 's goin' to rain, too,&rdquo; he added, as the rumble of thunder
      came up louder from the westward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That 's what I am hoping for,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;He 's used to mud. I have
      ridden him in it after cattle many a day. He can out-gallop any horse in
      the State in mud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robin looked at the young man keenly. He showed more shrewdness than he
      had given him credit for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kin he jump in mud?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can jump in anything. He can fly. If you just had let me take him over
      those fences&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robin changed the subject:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What 's his name? I got to go an' enter him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy told him. The old man's countenance changed, but the other did not
      see it. He was busy getting a roll of bills&mdash;by no means a large one&mdash;from
      his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much is it? I have the money all right.&rdquo; He proudly unrolled the
      money, mostly dollar bills. The old negro took the roll and counted the
      money slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is dis&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; he began, but stopped. After a minute's thought he
      went over them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heah.&rdquo; He took out about half the money, and handed the rest back. &ldquo;Wait.
      I 'll tend to it.&rdquo; He reached for his coat. &ldquo;Don't you do nuttin' to him
      while I 'm gone, an' don't you lef' him, not a minute.&rdquo; He put on his coat
      and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      His path led out from among the stables to the wing of one of the
      buildings where the superintendent and his staff had their offices. Here a
      colloquy took place between Robin and the cigar-smoking, dark-skinned
      clerk in charge, and then Robin left and paid a visit to another kind of
      official&mdash;an official on the main road, just outside the grounds, who
      kept an establishment which was divided into two departments. One was
      dignified by the word &ldquo;Café&rdquo; painted in black letters on the white ground
      of the painted pane, though on the door was the simple American word
      &ldquo;Bar.&rdquo; Over the door of the other was an attempt to portray three gilded
      balls. The proprietor of this bifurcated establishment, a man with red
      hair, a low forehead, a broad chin, and brawny shoulders, a long lip and
      long arms, rejoiced in the name of Nicholas Crimins, though by most of his
      customers he was irreverently called by a diminutive of that name. The
      principal part of his business undoubtedly came from the side of the
      establishment with the short name; but it was known to the
      stable-fraternity that on occasion &ldquo;Old Nick&rdquo; would make an advance to a
      needy borrower who was &ldquo;down on his luck&rdquo; of at least fifteen per cent, of
      almost any article's value. Saddles, bridles, watches, pistols,
      scarf-pins, and all the indiscriminate belongings of a race-track
      population were to be found in his &ldquo;store.&rdquo; And it was said that he had
      even been known to take over a stable when the owner found it necessary to
      leave the State on exceptionally short notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this odorous establishment old Robin now went and had a brief
      interview with the proprietor, whose surprise at the old trainer's
      proposition was unfeigned. As he knew Robin was not a gambler, the
      money-lender could set down his request to only one of two causes: either
      he had lost on a race that day, or he had &ldquo;points&rdquo; which made him willing
      to put up all he could raise on a horse next day. He tried him on the
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had bad luck to-day? I lost a pile myself,&rdquo; he began insinuatingly. &ldquo;Thim
      scoundrels 'll bate ivery horse they say a man look at. It 's a regular
      syn-dicate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor, I did n 't lay a dollar on a hoss to-day,&rdquo; declared Robin. He looked
      wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not that, reflected Mr. Crimins. Then it must be the other. Robin's
      look decided him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any news!&rdquo; he asked confidentially, leaning forward and dropping his
      husky voice. This meant, generally, had he heard of anything likely to
      change the chances of next day's race.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ur&mdash;who 's goin' to win the steep'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robin looked wiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;the' may be some surprises tomorrow. You keep your eyes open.
      Dese heah Yankee hosses don' always have dey own way&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I try to, but thim sheenies! Tell me what you know?&rdquo; His voice was a
      cajoling whisper now. &ldquo;They says Hurricane's&mdash;or is it Swallow's&mdash;!&rdquo;
       He was looking with exaggerated interest at something in his hand, waiting
      in hopes that Robin would take up the sentence and complete it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robin chuckled, and the chuckle was worth what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swallow 's too fat; Hurricane 's good, but it 's muscle an' wind an' de
      blood what tells in de last mile&mdash;blood an' bottom. You keep yer eye
      on a dark hoss. Gi' me meh money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The loan-broker still held on to the notes, partly from force of habit,
      while he asked: &ldquo;Who 's a-ridin' him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Robin reached for the bills and got them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody as knows how to ride,&rdquo; he said, oracularly. &ldquo;You 'll see
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he turned away the lender muttered an oath of disappointment The next
      moment he examined something curiously. Then he put it to his ear, and
      then in his pocket with a look of deep satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I 'll make this anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Robin came out of the shop, for the first time in twenty years he was
      without his big gold watch. He passed back by the secretary's office, and
      paid down the sum necessary to enter a horse in the next day's
      steeplechase. The clerk looked toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know the sun is down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De sun down! 'Tain't nothin' but de cloud. De sun 's a quarter of a hour
      high.&rdquo; Robin walked to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time is it by your watch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hit 's edzactly seven&mdash;&rdquo; His back was to the official.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted the clerk. &ldquo;Don't you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;lackin' six&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;the sun sets at ten minutes to seven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;lackin ' sixteen minutes forty-two seconds and a quarter,&rdquo; pursued
      Robin, with head bent as if he were looking at a watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you be hanged! Your old watch is always slow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My watch? Dis heah watch?&rdquo; He turned, buttoning his coat carefully. &ldquo;You
      know whar dis watch come f'om?&rdquo; He pressed his hand to his side and held
      it there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. Give me your money. It will help swell Carrier Pigeon's pile
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless he can fly,&rdquo; said Robin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What 's his name!&rdquo; The clerk had picked up his pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robin scratched his head in perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le' me see. I 'mos' forgit. Oh, yes.&rdquo; He gave the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Call him 'J. D.'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dat 'll do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, the horse was entered as &ldquo;J. D.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Robin stepped out of the door the first big drops of rain were just
      spattering down on the steps from the dark cloud that now covered all the
      western sky, and before he reached the stable it was pouring.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered the stall the young owner was on his knees in a corner, and
      before him was an open portmanteau from which he was taking something that
      made the old man's eyes glisten: an old jacket of faded orange-yellow
      silk, and a blue cap&mdash;the old Bullfield colors, that had once been
      known on every course in the country, and had often led the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robin gave an exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le' me see dat thing!&rdquo; He seized the jacket and held it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, Lord! I 's glad to see it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I ain' see it for so long. It
      's like home. Whar did you git dis thing, son! I 'd jest like to see it
      once mo' come home leadin' de field.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you shall see it doing that to-morrow,&rdquo; said the young fellow,
      boastfully, his face alight with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declar' I 'd gi' my watch to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short as his hand went to his side where the big gold timepiece
      had so long reposed, and he took it away with a sudden sense of loss.
      This, however, was but for a second. In a moment the old trainer was back
      in the past, telling his young master of the glories of the old stable&mdash;what
      races it had run and what stakes it had won.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm passed during the night, and the sun rose next morning clear and
      bright. One horse, at least, that was entered for the big race was well
      cared for. Robin had slept in his stall, and his young master had had his
      room. They had become great friends, and the young man had told the old
      trainer of his hopes. If he won he would have enough to send his sister
      off to school in the city, and he would go to college. Robin had entered
      into it heart and soul, and had given the boy all the advice he could
      hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robin was up by light, looking after the horse; and the young owner, after
      waiting long enough to take another lesson in the proper handling of a
      horse about to run, excused himself, and, leaving the horse with the old
      trainer, went out, he said, &ldquo;to exercise for his wind.&rdquo; This was a long
      walk; but the young rider's walk took him now, not along the track or the
      road, but along the steeplechase course, marked by the hurdles; and though
      the ground was wet and soggy on the flat, and in some places the water
      still stood, he appeared not to mind it in the least. So far from avoiding
      the pools, he plunged straight through them, walking backward and forward,
      testing the ground, and at every &ldquo;jump&rdquo; he made a particular examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned to the stable he was as wet as a &ldquo;drowned rat,&rdquo; but he
      looked well satisfied, and the old trainer, after he had talked with him a
      few minutes, was satisfied also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat boy 's he gran'pa's gran'chile,&rdquo; he muttered, well pleased with his
      account.

      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      The crowd that assembled at the course that afternoon was enough to fill
      the hearts of the management with joy, if a management has hearts. When
      the first race was called, the stands and paddocks were already filled,
      and the road was crowded with vehicles as far as the eye could see. The
      club and club-paddock filled later, as is the way with fashionable folk;
      but when the second race was called, these, too, were packed, and they
      looked, with the gay dresses of the throng that filled every foot of
      space, like great banks of flowers, while the noise that floated ont
      sounded like the hum of a vast swarm of bees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great race of the day was the fourth on the programme, and all minds
      were fastened on it, the interest in the other races being merely
      perfunctory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the big event the paddock was thronged with those who came to see
      the horses. A curious crowd they were&mdash;stout men, heavy-jawed and
      coarse-lipped; thin men, sharp-eyed and fox-faced; small, keen men,
      evil-looking boys, and round-faced, jovial-looking fellows&mdash;all
      stamped with <i>horse</i>. Among these mingled refined-looking gentlemen
      and fashionably dressed ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even under their blankets the horses were a fine-looking lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the crowd was a group of which the center was a young and very
      pretty girl. A simple white gown became her youth and freshness, and a
      large white hat with a long white ostrich-feather curled over the brim,
      shading her piquant face, added to her charm. A few pink roses fastened in
      her dress were the only color about her, except the roses in her cheeks.
      Most of those with her were men considerably older than herself. They
      appeared, rather, friends of her father, Colonel Ashland, a
      distinguished-looking gentleman, known to turfmen as the owner of one of
      the best stock-farms in the country. He loved horses, but never talked of
      them. The young lady had just left school, and had never seen a
      steeplechase before, and her eagerness kept her companions in continual
      merriment. They were bantering her to bet, which she had as yet refused to
      do. All were deeply interested in the race. Indeed, two of the gentlemen
      with Colonel Ashland, Colonel Snowden and Mr. Galloper, had horses entered
      in the steeplechase; and as they examined the horses and made observations
      on them apt as a proverb, many of the bystanders strained their ears to
      catch their words, in hopes of getting a few last points on which to lay
      their bets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurricane, a medium-sized bay, was next to the favorite; but Swallow, a
      big-boned sorrel, was on his form going up in the betting, and Mr.
      Galloper was in fine spirits. He was bantering his friend for odds that
      his big chestnut with the cherry colors would not beat the favorite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently in the round came, led by an elderly negro, whose face wore a
      look portentous of mystery, a big horse covered with a sheet. A set of
      clean legs appeared below the sheet, and the head set on the long,
      muscular neck was fine enough for a model.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What horse is that?&rdquo; asked one of the gentlemen. It was the same question
      that many were asking as the horse walked with a long, easy swing, as
      quiet, yet as much at home, as if he were in his own stable-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! that must be the new entry&mdash;'J. D.,'&rdquo; said Colonel Snowden,
      pushing forward to get a good look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose horse is this, Robin?&rdquo; enquired Colonel Ashland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old fellow touched his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dis is Mr. Johnstone hoss, suh.&rdquo; He spoke with pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a very distinguished name,&rdquo; laughed one of the others, Mr. Newby, a
      youngish man dressed in the latest race-course style. He wore bits and
      stirrups as pins and fobs, owned a few horses, and &ldquo;talked horse&rdquo;
       continually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Robin sniffed disdainfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it may be,&rdquo; said the young girl, turning her eyes on him with a
      little flash. She saw that the old darkey had caught the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Mr. Johnston is it, uncle?&rdquo; she asked, kindly, with a step forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Theod'ric Johnston, madam.&rdquo; He spoke with pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! <i>Colonel</i> Theodoric Johnston? Is he living still?&rdquo; asked
      Colonel Ashland. &ldquo;I thought he&mdash;How is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nor, suh! He 's dead. He died about three years ago. Dis gent'man is
      the gran'son&mdash;one o' my young masters. I was the fust pusson ever put
      him on a hoss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can he ride?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kin he ride! You wait an' see him,&rdquo; laughed the old man. &ldquo;He ought to be
      able to ride! Ken a bud fly? Heah he now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned as the young owner, brown and tanned, and hardly more than a
      boy, came up through the crowd. He, like his horse, had been carefully
      groomed, and through his sun tan he bore a look of distinction. He was
      dressed for the race, but wore a coat over his faded silk jacket. As he
      turned and found Robin talking to a lady, his cap came off instinctively.
      The men looked at him scrutinizingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you Colonel Theodoric Johnston's grandson?&rdquo; enquired Colonel Snowden.
      &ldquo;He used to have some fine horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; His eye stole to the horse that was just beside him, and the
      color mounted to his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he was a fine man. The turf lost one of its best ornaments when he
      retired.&rdquo; Colonel Ashland was the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.&rdquo; His cap was in his hand, his words and manner
      were respectful, but when he spoke he looked the other in the eyes, and
      his eyes, though shy, were clear and calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were just admiring your horse,&rdquo; said the young lady, graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and looked at her with the color flashing up in his tanned
      cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I am glad if he meets with your approval.&rdquo; He ended his formal
      little speech with a quaint, slow bow. &ldquo;I wish he were worthier of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am sure he is,&rdquo; she said, politely. &ldquo;At least, you have our good
      wishes.&rdquo; Her eye fell on one of her companions. &ldquo;Has n't he, Mr. Newby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter only looked at the younger man and grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at least you have mine,&rdquo; she said, with an air of bravado.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I 'll try to deserve them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat young lady knows a hoss,&rdquo; asserted old Robin, triumphantly. &ldquo;Jes look
      at him, dyah. What bone an' muscle!&rdquo; He raised the sheet and waved his
      dusky hand towards his charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that 's what I say. Such bone and muscle!&rdquo; she repeated, with
      pretended gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially the bone!&rdquo; observed Mr. Newby, in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall back him,&rdquo; she said. She held in her hand a rose which had broken
      off its stem. She took it and stuck it in a loop in the sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the first bell sounded, and the hostlers began to get the horses
      ready to appear before the judges, while the riders went off to weigh in,
      and the crowd began to stream back to the stands. As the group turned
      away, the young owner took the rose from the loop and, with a shy look
      around, hid it in the breast of his jacket. His eye followed the white hat
      till it passed out of the paddock gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really think that horse can win?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newby of the young
      lady, as they strolled along. &ldquo;Because I tell you he can't. I thought you
      were a sport. Why, look at his hocks! He won't get over the Liverpool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall back him,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;What is the Liverpool?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, I 'll tell you what I 'll do,&rdquo; said Mr. Newby. &ldquo;I 'll bet you two
      to one he does n't win the race.&rdquo; He winked at the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I don't approve of betting, but I 'll do it this time just to
      punish you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I 'll bet you two to one he does n't come in second&mdash;that boy
      won't get him over the water-jump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;no, I don't want to take odds. I 'll bet you even. I must
      be a sport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other protested, while the rest of the party looked on with amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, if you insist,&rdquo; said Mr. Newby. &ldquo;What shall it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A box of the best&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the best cigars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don't smoke. Candy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you expect to win!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Who ever saw such bone and muscle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They reached their places in the box, smiling and bowing to their
      acquaintances about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they were settled, the young lady picked up a paper lying by,
      and began to search diligently for the name of her horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, here it is!&rdquo; She began to read. It was a column of forecasts. &ldquo;Tell
      me, please, what does '100 to 1' mean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That the horse is selling at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Selling? What does that meant&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an explosion of laughter from those about her. They explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what cheats men are!&rdquo; she exclaimed with conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, I 'll let you off if you ask quarter,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Newby. &ldquo;No horse
      can jump with knees as big as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never! I 'll back him to the end,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Oh, there he is now!
      There is his yellow jacket,&rdquo; she added, as the buzz grew louder about
      them, and glasses were levelled at the horses as they filed by spirited
      and springy on their way to the starting-point some furlongs down the
      course. No one else appeared to be looking at the big brown. But his rider
      was scanning the boxes till his eye rested on a big hat with a white
      feather; then he sat up very straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of the gentlemen came up from the paddock. Colonel Snowden had the
      horse that was next to the favorite. They were now talking over the
      chances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what are you going to do? How do you stand?&rdquo; his friends asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good chance to win. I don't know what that new horse can do, of course;
      but I should not think he could beat Hurricane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he cannot,&rdquo; said Mr. Newby. &ldquo;Ridden by a green country boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has some good points and has a fine pedigree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Newby raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;So has his rider; but pedigrees don't
      count in rides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never could understand why blood should count in horses and not in
      men,&rdquo; said Miss Ashland, placidly. &ldquo;Oh, I hope he 'll win!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
      turning her eager face and glancing back at the gentlemen over her
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I like that!&rdquo; laughed Colonel Snowden. &ldquo;With all that money on the
      race! I thought you were backing Hurricane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but he hasn't anybody to back him,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;No; I sha 'nt
      back Hurricane. I shall back him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which? The horse or the rider?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horse&mdash;no, both!&rdquo; she declared, firmly. &ldquo;And oh, papa,&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, glancing back at him over her shoulder, &ldquo;they say he wants to
      win to send his sister to school and to go to college himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must say you seem to have learned a good deal about him for the
      time you had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded brightly. &ldquo;That 's what the old colored man told a friend of
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he does n't go to college till he wins with that horse,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Newby, &ldquo;he is likely to find his education abbreviated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall back him, anyhow.&rdquo; She settled herself in her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, I 'll tell you what I will do. I will bet you he don't get a
      place,&rdquo; said Mr. Newby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much? What is a 'place'?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was explained to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much&mdash;a hundred to one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; not that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 're learning,&rdquo; laughed her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! they 're off. Here they come!&rdquo; buzzed the crowd, as the flag at
      last fell, and they came up the field, a dozen in all, two in the lead,
      then a half-dozen together in a bunch, and two or three behind, one in the
      rear of all. Old Robin's heart dropped as the cry went up: &ldquo;The countryman
      's left. It 's yellow-jacket!&rdquo; It was too far off for him to see clearly,
      but the laughter about him was enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That boy don't know how to ride. What did they put him in for?&rdquo; they
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later, however, the tone changed. The country boy was coming up,
      and was holding his horse in, too. The riders were settling themselves and
      spreading out, getting their horses in hand for the long gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the old trainer's last piece of advice to his young pupil was
      worthy of a Delphic track,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don' let 'em lef you; but don't let 'em wind you. Don't git so far behind
      't folks 'll think you 's ridin' in de next race; but save him for de last
      half-mile. You 'll have plenty o' room den to let him out, an' de track 's
      mighty heavy. Watch Hurricane an' Fightin' Creek. Keep nigh 'em, but save
      him, an' look out for de Liverpool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was on this advice that the young rider was acting, and though he was
      in the rear at the start he did not mind it. He saw that two or three
      riders were trying to set the pace to kill off the other horses, and he
      held his horse in, picking his ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they passed two or three fences, the horses in the same order, and came
      toward the water-jump in front of the stands. It was a temptation to rush
      for it, for the safest chance was in front, and the eyes of thousands were
      on them. Some of the riders did rush, and the leaders got over it well;
      but in the bunch two horses struck and went down, one going over and
      turning a complete somersault on the other side, the other from a false
      take-off falling back on the near side, with his rider almost under him,
      immediately in front of young Johnston's horse. Whether it was the fall of
      the two horses with the splash of the water in the ditch beyond, or
      whether it was the sudden twitch that Johnston gave his bridle to turn the
      brown as the horse and rider rolled almost immediately before him, or
      whether it was all these taken together, the brown horse swerved and
      refused turning entirely back, while the rest of the field swept on. The
      other horses and riders had scrambled to their feet, and the mind of the
      crowd was relieved. They broke into a great shout of laughter as the rider
      of the brown deliberately rode the horse back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going the wrong way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He 's going to meet 'em!&rdquo; they shouted, derisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the gentlemen about the young girl of the white hat in the club box
      who had backed the brown horse could not help joining in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Miss Catherine, where are you?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newby. &ldquo;Will you allow
      that I can pick a horse better than you? If so, I 'll let you off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He pulled him out to avoid striking those other men,&rdquo; declared the girl,
      warmly. &ldquo;I saw him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nonsense! Who ever heard of a man pulling out in a steeplechase to
      avoid striking another horse? I have heard of a man pulling out to avoid
      killing his own horse; but that boy pulled out because his horse refused.
      That horse had more sense than he. He knew he could n't take it. Hello!
      what 's he doing?&rdquo; For young Johnston, his face set hard, had turned his
      horse and headed him again toward the jump. At that moment the other
      horses were rising the slope on top of which was the next jump, and the
      brown caught sight of them. He had appeared till now a little bewildered;
      but the effect was electrical. His head went up, his ears went forward; a
      sudden fury seemed to seize him, and he shot forward like a rocket, while
      the crowd on the other side of the track hooted in derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! He 'll go down if he rushes like that,&rdquo; cried the men in the
      box. But he did not. He hardly appeared to see the fence before him any
      more than he heard the jeers of the crowd. With high head and pointed
      ears, he dashed at it, taking it in his stride, and clearing it with a
      mighty bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd in the stands, carried away, burst into a storm of applause, and
      the gentlemen about the young girl of the big white hat clapped their
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Robin, down in the paddock, was shouting and talking volubly to a
      crowd of strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He 's a jumper! He 's got de pedigree. Dat 's blood. You ain' see my old
      master's hosses befo'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your old master's horses!&rdquo; growled a gruff voice behind him. &ldquo;You made me
      lose fifty dollars on yer blanked horse wid yer blanked lies. You 'll pay
      it back or yer won't see that watch ag'in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robin glanced at the angry pawnbroker, but he did not have time to argue
      then. The horse galloping up the long slope before the stables engrossed
      his attention. He simply edged away from his reviler, who went off to
      &ldquo;hedge&rdquo; his bets, if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He 's a good horse, but he 's out of the race,&rdquo; said one of the gentlemen
      who had been bantering Miss Ashland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but he never had a chance&mdash;a mere flash. You can't expect a
      common pick-up to run against a field like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Newby turned back to the girl, who was leaning forward watching the
      horse going over the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Catherine, ready to ask terms yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; was n't that the water-jump!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but he has got to go over it again. Come, I 'll bet you twenty to
      one he does n't win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I 'll bet you a hundred and twenty to one he does n't get a place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I 'll even things up, and bet you he does n't come in&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; said the girl, turning on him with a sudden flash. &ldquo;He shall come
      in, if I have to go down there and ride him in myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An exclamation from one of the others broke in on this banter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed if he is n't gaining on them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And sure enough, as the brown horse came out from beyond the hill, though
      he was still far to the rear of the field, he had undoubtedly lessened the
      gap between them. The young girl's eyes sparkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he can't keep it up. He 's riding his heart out,&rdquo; said one of the
      other gentlemen, with his glasses to his eyes. &ldquo;But he 's a better horse
      than I thought, and if he had had a rider he might&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has got to make the Liverpool, and he 'll never do it,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Newby. &ldquo;There he goes now. Watch him. Jupiter! he 's over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see that jump? He 's got stuff in him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not enough. He 's got to go around once and a half yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blue is leading.&rdquo; &ldquo;Red-jacket is coming up.&rdquo; &ldquo;The green is done for,&rdquo;
       etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it went, with the horses coming around the curve for the second time.
      The favorite and about half the others were running well, their riders
      beginning to take the pace they proposed to keep to the end. Several
      others were trailing along behind at various distances, among them the two
      horses that had shot out in the lead at first, and behind all but the last
      one, which was manifestly already beaten, the big brown horse, galloping
      with head still up and ears still pointed forward, bent on catching the
      horses ahead of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The field swept by the stands, most of them getting safely over the big
      water-jump, though several of the horses struck hard, and one of them went
      on his knees, pitching his rider over his head. The country horse had
      still to take the leap, and all eyes were on him, for it was the jump he
      had refused. Bets were offered that he would refuse again, or that after
      his killing chase he would be too winded to clear it and would go down. At
      any rate, they agreed the boy who was riding him was crazy, and he could
      never last to come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Robin ran across the track to try and stop him. He waved his arms
      wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull out. You 'll kill him! Save him for another time. Don't kill him!&rdquo;
       he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the young rider was of a different mind. The vision of two girls was
      in his thoughts&mdash;one a young girl down on an old plantation, and the
      other a girl in white in a front box in the club. She had looked at him
      with kind eyes and backed him against the field. He would win or die.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse, too, had his life in the race. Unheeding the wild waving of the
      old trainer's arms, he swept by him with head still up and ears still
      forward, his eyes riveted on the horses galloping in front of him. Once or
      twice his ears were bent toward the big fence as if to gauge it, and then
      his eyes looked off to the horses running up the slope beyond it. When he
      reached the jump he rose so far from it that a cry of anxiety went up. But
      it changed to a wild shout of applause as he cleared everything in his
      stride and lighted far beyond the water. Old Robin, whose arms were high
      in the air with horror as he rose, dropped them, and then, jerking off his
      hat, he waved it wildly around his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can fly. He ain't a hoss at all; he 's a bud!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Let him
      go, son; let him go! You 'll win yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But horse and rider were beyond the reach of his voice, galloping up the
      slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more they all disappeared behind the hill, and once more the leaders
      came out, one ahead of the others, then two together, then two more,
      running along the inside of the fence toward the last jumps, where they
      would strike the clear track and come around the turn into the home
      stretch. The other horses were trailing behind the five leaders when they
      went over the hill. Now, as they came out again, one of the second batch
      was ahead of all the others and was making up lost ground after the
      leaders. Suddenly a cry arose: &ldquo;The yellow! The orange! It 's the
      countryman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible! It is, and he is overhauling 'em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he lives over the Liverpool, he 'll get a place,&rdquo; said one of the
      gentlemen in the club box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he can't do it. He must be dead,&rdquo; said Mr. Newby. &ldquo;There goes one
      now. The red-jacket 's down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'm out,&rdquo; said Mr. Galloper. &ldquo;He 's up all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He 'll get over,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Oh, I can't look! Tell me when he 's
      safe.&rdquo; She buried her face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he goes. Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is he down!&rdquo; she panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jove! No&mdash;he 's over clear and clean, running like a streak,&rdquo; said
      the gentleman, with warm admiration. &ldquo;He 's safe now. Only two more
      hurdles. It 's all clear. That boy is riding him, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl sprang to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your glasses. It is&mdash;it is! He 's safe!&rdquo; she cried. She
      turned to Newby who stood next to her. &ldquo;Ask quarter and I 'll let you
      off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He 'll never be able to stand the track. It 's fetlock-deep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at that moment the horses turned into the track, and the real race
      began. Newby's prophecy went to the winds. As was seen, the leaders were
      riding against each other. They had dropped out of account all the other
      horses. They had not even seen the brown. The first thing they knew was
      the shout from the crowd ahead of them, blown down to them hoarsely as the
      big brown horse wheeled into the stretch behind them. He was ahead of the
      other horses and was making hotly after the four horses in the lead. He
      was running now with neck outstretched; but he was running, and he was
      surely closing up the gap. The blood of generations of four-mile winners
      was flaming in his veins. It was even possible that he might get a place.
      The crowd began to be excited. They packed against the fences, straining
      their necks.
    </p>
    <p>
      How he was running! One by one he picked them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He 's past the fourth horse, and is up with the third!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd began to shout, to yell, to scream. The countryman, not content
      with a place, was bent on winning the race. He was gaining, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two leaders, being well separated, were easing up, Hurricane, the bay,
      in front, the black, the favorite, next, with the third well to the rear.
      The trainers were down at the fence, screaming and waving their arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      They saw the danger that the riders had forgot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on! Come on!&rdquo; they shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Robin was away down the track, waving like mad. Suddenly the rider of
      the second horse saw his error. The rush of a horse closing up on him
      caught his ear. He looked around to see a big brown horse with a white
      blaze in the forehead, that he had not seen since the start, right at his
      quarter, about to slip between him and the fence. He had just time to draw
      in to the fence, and for a moment there was danger of the two horses
      coming down together.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight old Robin gave a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at him! Runnin' my hoss in de fence! Cut him down! Cut him down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the brown's rider pulled his horse around, came by on the outside, and
      drew up to the flank of the first horse. He was gaining so fast that the
      crowd burst into shouts, some cheering on the leader, some the great brown
      which had made such a race.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boxes were a babel. Everyone was on his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The yellow 's gaining!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the blue 's safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orange may get it,&rdquo; said Colonel Ashland. &ldquo;He 's the best horse, and well
      ridden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was up to the bay's flank. Whip and spur were going as the leader saw
      his danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Robin was like a madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on! Come on!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Give him de whip&mdash;cut him in two&mdash;lift
      him! Look at him&mdash;my hoss! Come on, son! Oh, ef my ol' master was
      jest heah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A great roar ran along the fences and over the paddock and stands as the
      two horses shot in together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he has won, he has won!&rdquo; cried the girl in the big hat, springing up
      on a chair in ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it 's the blue by a neck,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;I congratulate you,
      Snowden. But that 's a great horse. It 's well that it was not a furlong
      farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said the owner of the winner, hurrying away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have cheated him. I am sure he won,&rdquo; asserted the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      They laughed at her enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Newby,&rdquo; said one of the gentlemen, &ldquo;you 'd better get Miss Catherine to
      pick your horses for you.&rdquo; Newby winced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it 's easy!&rdquo; said the girl, nonchalantly, &ldquo;Bone and muscle&mdash;and
      a green country boy&mdash;with a pedigree.&rdquo;

    </h2>
    <p>
      As Johnston was leading his horse away, the gentleman who had fallen at
      the water-jump came up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to thank you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I saw you pull him around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid I 'd strike you,&rdquo; said the other, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then two gentlemen pushed through the crowd. One was Mr. Newby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the owner of this horse!&rdquo; he asked the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; He spoke with pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat he is de owner,&rdquo; put in old Robin, who had the bridle, &ldquo;an' he owns a
      good hoss! He got de ambition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to sell him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-um-hm&mdash;d' n' know. I came on to sell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you sell him. Don't you never sell him,&rdquo; urged the old trainer.
      &ldquo;Keep him, an' le' me handle him for you. You 'll git mo' 'n second money
      next time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'll give you a thousand dollars for him. What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Robin gave an exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand dollars! For dis hoss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman's friend broke in:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, Newby, don't rob the boy. He 'll give you two thousand,&rdquo; he
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were examining the horse as he walked along under his blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two thousand?&rdquo; The boy was hesitating. It was a great sum to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I 'll split the difference,&rdquo; said Mr. Newby: &ldquo;I 'll give you
      fifteen hundred for him if he is as good as I think him when I look him
      over. What 's his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jefferson Davis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the devil! I 'll change his name pretty quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you won't,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't I? I 'll show you when I get him,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Well, what do you
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you promise not to change his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much! When I buy him he 's my horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He 'll never be your horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He 's not for sale.&rdquo; He turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nonsense! Here; wait&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not sell him to you, sir, at any price. Good-morning.&rdquo; He moved
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 've lost a good horse,&rdquo; said his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I 'll get him yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so,&rdquo; said Colonel Ashland, who, with his daughter on his
      arm, had come up to congratulate the young rider.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I might have won for you,&rdquo; said the young man to Miss Ashland. His
      cap was in his hand and he made the same quaint bow that he had made
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you did win; at least, you ought to have had it. My father says
      he is a great horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the words the color mounted to his sunburned cheeks. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he
      said, and looked suddenly deep into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put out her hand to pet the horse, and he turned and rested his head
      against her. She gave an exclamation of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! father, look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know our friends,&rdquo; said young Johnston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat we does. She 's de on'ies one as bet on him,&rdquo; asserted old Robin.
      &ldquo;Dat young lady knows a good hoss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that boy?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newby, as the horse was led away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A green country boy with a pedigree,&rdquo; said a low voice at his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does he come from!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Virginia,&rdquo; said Colonel Ashland. &ldquo;And his name is Theodoric Johnston. It
      's bred in the bone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Next morning as young Johnston rode his horse out of the stable gate, old
      Robin walked at his side. Just in front of the pawn-shop Robin pulled out
      his watch and examined it carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don' mind but one thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I did n't have dis yisterday to
      hol' de time on him. But nem mind: wait tell nex' season.&rdquo;
